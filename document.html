            <h4 class="darker">the mechanical components</h4>
            <p>for the giving system of soft-robotics the main actuators that faciliate motion are the artifical muscles by controling there attirbutes you can control the degree of contracting and flexing witch in terms control the bones of the system this algorthem aim to calculate the motion in the system when given actuator input is present and it do so by : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>- first taking system x with it phsyical components.</li>
                <li>- how many bones in the system.</li>
                <li>- how many artifical muscle groups in the system.</li>
                <li>- how the diffrent muscle groupe effect each bone in the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4  class="darker">muscle memory attirbutes</h4>
            <p>human depend on muscle memory in a lot of thing on servral activities the muscle memory is one of many functions produced by brain activity it used in pattrens of movement pattrens of speach and langues and many other things this algorthim aim to make very simplifyed mathmentical description of the functionality of the muscle memmory and it do so by the following : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>- first establishing parameters for the network.</li>
                <li>- those parametes make the memory.</li>
                <li>- when an action is made for the first time a pattren emerge.</li>
                <li>- every time the same action is made the pattren grow stronger.</li>
                <li>- this action then could be used again either by stimulatus input or a smart network decision.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">note : for now this simulator don't acount for vectors but a little bit in the future it will.</p>

            <h2  class="darker">interface</h2>
            <h4 class="darker">the mechanical components</h4>
            <p>here you can enter the phsyical components that make the system; the bones in the system and the muscle groups effects on the bones. </p>
            <h4  class="darker">muscle memory attirbutes</h4>
            <p>here you can enter the attirbutes for the network attirbutes for the muscle memory witch is the parameters in the muscle momery and the reslution of the memomry; the reslution mean that for every action is made how many parameters can take the more reslution the better for complex action not action are the same after all.</p>
            <p class="note">coming soon action chain witch need adjustment to the algorthim to make a groupe of actions memorized togther; and reaction to stimuli that is when a stimuli is recognized an action or action group is activated</p>
            <h4  class="darker">simulator</h4>
            <p>after saving your actions press simulate to begin the simulation then you will see your action list press on an action to begin memorizing it every time you press the same action the action become more dominante more dominante actions mean the easire to excute again just like humans when you learn a new skill like writing with hand for example first time you do it you have to adjust and think about but every time you train it and think about it the more it become second nature; or me writing this word for example i just think of words to type it and my hands know what to do (thank you hands).</p>
            <h4 class="darker">report</h4>
            <p>after your done click report on the top right corner it will show you report of your system you bones and muscle groups and the action on every muscle group the state of the muscle memory and the action you made effect on them.</p>
