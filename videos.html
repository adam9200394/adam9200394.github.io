            <h2>how does it work</h2>
            <h4>upper arm</h4>
            <p>as you can see the arm have two main bones starting from the shoulders the first bone connect to the shoulder via ball-socket joint just like in humans; this shoulder bone is controlled buy two main muscle group  the first muscle groupe start from the the middle of the shoulder plate and connect to the top of shoulder ball joint and when it contract it pulls on the ball joint providing motion the second work the same but in the other direction.</p>
            <h4>forarm</h4>
            <p>the second bone have two muscle group also the first is equivalent to the biceps in human arm when in contract it pull the muscle bone forward; however the joint between the forarm bone and the upper arm isn't like the shoulder joint in that is slide in joint when the foram bone joint move toward teh upper arm bone the first bone cavity slide into the second bone cavity </p>
            <h4>wrist and fingers</h4>
            <p>the wrist work mostly the same as the other two bone but have a more free joint the allow more flexiblity the fingers on other hand (this hand not the other) have for bones each every finger start from the base of the wrist and connect to three other bones; every finger has three joints between each finger they are slide-in joint just like the forarm and the upper arm joint; every finger is moved by two muscle goups also one in the back of the finger that when flexed flex the finger and ther the other connect between two joint and when contracted move the bone attached to it.</p>
